# MedRelay üöëüè•üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è [Project Start Date: 7/31/2024]
MedRelay is a platform designed to revolutionize healthcare communication by streamlining the exchange of critical information between ambulances and hospitals. By integrating advanced AI technologies into our app, we enhance the speed and accuracy of emergency responses, therefore helping healthcare professionals make informed decisions swiftly and effectively, saving lives.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for MedRelay was brought forth from the urgent need to enhance communication in emergency medical situations. During critical moments, every second counts, and we saw the limitations of traditional two-way radios in providing timely and accurate information between ambulances and hospitals.

Witnessing the impact of delayed or miscommunicated information on patient outcomes inspired us to create a solution that uses modern technology to streamline and improve this exchange of info. By integrating real-time data transcription and AI analysis, we aim to provide healthcare professionals with the tools they need to anticipate and address patient needs more effectively.

Our goal was to develop a platform that not only bridges communication gaps but also provides medical teams with the tools to deliver faster, more informed care, ultimately saving lives. MedRelay embodies our commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in healthcare communication and making a tangible difference in the communities we serve.

## Features

- **Live Transcription**: Captures and transcribes patient data every 2 seconds, streaming it directly to the hospital for real-time monitoring.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Utilizes GPT-4 to analyze incoming data, generating potential diagnoses and treatment recommendations to aid hospital staff in their preparations.
- **ID Connectivity**: Connects ambulances and hospitals using unique IDs, ensuring organized data management and minimizing errors.
- **Customizable UI**: Built with a Next.js frontend, allowing hospitals to tailor the dashboard to fit their workflow seamlessly.
- **Secure and Fast**: Uses MongoDB for backend security and speed, ensuring data is both protected and quickly retrievable.
- **Historical Data Access**: Provides hospitals with the ability to download previous transcripts and manage active/inactive IDs efficiently.
- **By-Organization Database**: Each organization establishes its own dedicated database to connect with MedRelay, ensuring privacy and secure access to data. This design is highly effective as it eliminates the risk of retrieving incorrect or unauthorized sensitive information while providing tailored solutions to meet each organization's specific needs.

## Challenges Faced

Developing MedRelay presented several challenges that pushed our team to innovate and adapt:

- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Implementing a system capable of capturing and transcribing patient data every 2 seconds was a significant technical challenge for us. Ensuring low latency and high accuracy required optimization of both our data handling processes and the AI model integration, which leads us to the next point.

- **AI Integration**: Integrating GPT-4 for real-time analysis of medical data posed difficulties, particularly in balancing speed and accuracy. Our initial attempts using specialized medical language models, such as Medical-Llama, were too slow for our needs, more or less forcing us to fine-tune GPT-4 to meet the demands of real-time processing.

- **Data Security and Privacy**: Handling sensitive medical information requires rigorous data security measures. We used MongoDB, trusted by eBay, Toyota, Uber , and more to ensure secure data handling.

- **User Interface Design**: Creating a customizable and intuitive user interface that meets the diverse needs of healthcare providers was another challenge. We had to go through multiple iterations of designs to ensure ambulances and hospitals could accesss what they needed in "5 clicks or less" - login (2 clicks), role button + id (2 clicks), and finally "start recording" - 1 click ( 5 total for ambulance, 4 for hospital). 

- **System Reliability**: Ensuring consistent connectivity and data integrity between large distances required extensive testing. We developed mechanisms to manage data flow effectively, even in environments with varying network conditions. For example, I (Aayush) was in Hawaii for a break during this time, and we tested it with Michael in California. It worked seamlessly.

Despite these challenges, our dedication and collaboration enabled us to create a robust and effective solution that improves healthcare communication.

## Innovation

MedRelay is a groundbreaking platform that introduces several innovative features to revolutionize healthcare communication:

- **Seamless AI Integration**: By incorporating GPT-4, MedRelay offers real-time analysis of patient data, providing hospital staff with proactive insights and recommendations. This integration allows healthcare providers to anticipate patient needs and prepare more effectively, enhancing the quality of care.

- **Dynamic Transcription System**: Our platform captures and transcribes data every 2 seconds, ensuring that hospitals have access to the most up-to-date patient information. This real-time transcription capability improves situational awareness and aids in quick decision-making during critical moments.

- **Customizable User Interface**: Built with Next.js, MedRelay offers a highly adaptable user interface that can be tailored to fit the unique workflows of different healthcare providers. This flexibility enhances usability and ensures that the platform integrates smoothly into existing systems.

- **Enhanced Connectivity**: MedRelay connects ambulances and hospitals using unique IDs, streamlining data management and reducing the risk of errors. This feature ensures that all communications are organized and accessible, facilitating better coordination between emergency response teams and hospital staff.

- **Robust Security Measures**: Our use of MongoDB for backend storage ensures that all patient data is handled with the highest standards of security and speed. We prioritize data protection and compliance with healthcare regulations to build trust with our users.

MedRelay‚Äôs innovative approach to emergency medical communication not only optimizes existing processes but also sets new standards for how technology can be leveraged to improve patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.
