MedRelay is an innovative platform designed to revolutionize healthcare communication by streamlining the exchange of critical information between ambulances and hospitals. By integrating advanced AI technologies, MedRelay enhances the speed and accuracy of emergency responses, helping healthcare professionals make informed decisions swiftly and effectively.

## Features

- **Live Transcription**: Captures and transcribes patient data every 2 seconds, streaming it directly to the hospital for real-time monitoring.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Utilizes GPT-4 to analyze incoming data, generating potential diagnoses and treatment recommendations to aid hospital staff in their preparations.
- **ID Connectivity**: Connects ambulances and hospitals using unique IDs, ensuring organized data management and minimizing errors.
- **Customizable UI**: Built with a Next.js frontend, allowing hospitals to tailor the dashboard to fit their workflow seamlessly.
- **Secure and Fast**: Uses MongoDB for backend security and speed, ensuring data is both protected and quickly retrievable.
- **Historical Data Access**: Provides hospitals with the ability to download previous transcripts and manage active/inactive IDs efficiently.

## Challenges Faced

Developing MedRelay presented several challenges that pushed our team to innovate and adapt:

- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Implementing a system capable of capturing and transcribing patient data every 2 seconds was a significant technical challenge. Ensuring low latency and high accuracy required optimization of both our data handling processes and the AI model integration.

- **AI Integration**: Integrating GPT-4 for real-time analysis of medical data posed difficulties, particularly in balancing speed and accuracy. Our initial attempts using specialized medical language models, such as Medical-Llama, were too slow for our needs, prompting us to fine-tune GPT-4 to meet the demands of real-time processing.

- **Data Security and Privacy**: Handling sensitive medical information necessitated rigorous data security measures. Ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations and maintaining robust encryption and access controls were essential in building trust with healthcare providers.

- **User Interface Design**: Creating a customizable and intuitive user interface that meets the diverse needs of healthcare providers was another challenge. We focused on user feedback to refine the Next.js frontend, making it both adaptable and user-friendly.

- **System Reliability**: Ensuring consistent connectivity and data integrity between ambulances and hospitals required extensive testing and refinement. We developed mechanisms to manage data flow effectively, even in environments with varying network conditions.

Despite these challenges, our team's dedication and collaboration enabled us to create a robust and effective solution that improves healthcare communication.
